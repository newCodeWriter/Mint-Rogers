This is a photographer's website. The photographer's name is Mint Rogers. 
The website includes a homepage, a page for the photographer's portfolio, a page about the photographer, and a page to contact the photographer. All four HTML pages are linked to one another and one CSS stylesheet. 
A menu bar is included at the top of each HTML page for ease of use and navigation. Social media icons are part of the menu bar so that the visitor can learn more about the photographer or contact the photographer on other platforms. 
A footer describing the services offered is included on the Home and About pages. 
On the Work page, I added a script to change the font color of the menu bar to 'white' onload. There is a dark background image behind the menu bar. 
I have also included a "back to top" link at the bottom of the Work page.

Ideas for future improvement.
Adding more media queries for smaller devices. 
Having a "back to top" button in Work page that scrolls with page. 
Adding a pricing page.
